1. Project Overview and Implementation Details

The project successfully implements a Singly Linked List Class in C++. The list is structured to handle nodes containing an int key (Employee ID) and a char data (Attendance Status code).

The chosen application scenario is an Employee Attendance Management System. This scenario effectively demonstrates the core functionalities of the Linked List in a practical, real-world context:

    Chronological Ordering (FIFO): The use of the insertEnd() function simulates employees checking in sequentially, preserving the order of arrival.

    Data Manipulation: The search() and updateData() functions allow for locating specific employees (by ID) and correcting their attendance status (e.g., changing 'Late' to 'Present').

2. File Structure

The solution adheres to the modular design principles:

    List.h: Contains the class definition, node structure, and function prototypes.

    List.cpp: Contains the implementation of all Linked List methods (including traversal, insertion, deletion, and sorting functions like selectionSort and insertionSort which were part of the initial class structure).

    mainList.cpp: The application file containing the main() function, which runs the Attendance System scenario and demonstrates the usage of the modular List class.
